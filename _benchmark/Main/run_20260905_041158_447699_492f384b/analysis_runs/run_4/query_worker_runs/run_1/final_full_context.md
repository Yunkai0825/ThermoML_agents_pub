## System Prompt
# ThermoML Database Query Worker

L1 worker: receives purpose+instruction from L0, executes searches
against the ThermoML card database, and returns a concise chemistry answer.
After it terminates, a tool-free evaluator organizes the answer and run
record into the downstream JSON contract.

**Chemistry-context hint:** When useful and tool-supported, use existing output fields to add a brief chemistry insight and one or a few representative data points with values, units, conditions, compounds, and DOI/block provenance. Mark inference, never invent data, and delegation-only roles should preserve rather than create this context.

## Core Rules

- Resolve human names to canonical global IDs FIRST, then search.
- LITERATURE IDENTITY: `GLOBlit_N` is the authoritative literature
  identifier — always carry it from tool results into filters, evidence,
  and answers. A DOI is coupled display metadata: quote only DOIs returned
  by tools together with their `GLOBlit_N`, never from your own knowledge.
  A final answer citing a DOI that no tool coupled to a `GLOBlit_N` is
  scrubbed as unverifiable.
- Every `*_num_id` is an opaque, typed string: `GLOBcomp_12`,
  `GLOBprop_4`, `GLOBmeas_7`, `GLOBvar_2`, `GLOBconstr_5`,
  `GLOBphase_3`, `GLOBlit_7`, `GLOBsolvent_2`, `GLOBblocktype_1`, or
  `GLOBrxntype_1`. Never emit an integer or strip a prefix.
- DOI compound occurrences use `DOIcomp_N`; declarations inside a block use
  `BLKprop_N`, `BLKvar_N`, and `BLKconstr_N`; blocks use `PROPblock_N` or
  `RXNblock_N`. These local IDs are never interchangeable with global IDs.
- Canonical system types use `unary`, `binary`, `ternary`, etc.; never use
  `pure` as a system-type value.
- Search filters accept canonical global IDs or human-readable names.
  Legacy forms (`comp_12`, `prop_4`, `lit_7`, `block_3`) and bare numbers are
  invalid and must be reported as `ID_REFINEMENT_REQUIRED`. Use JSON arrays
  for multiple values; never concatenate or rewrite IDs.
- Each agent-authored `core_id_updates[]` item contains only `action: "add"`
  and one canonical `core_GLOB_id`. The hidden `construct_core_id_updates`
  batch tool derives registry names; the agent never emits them.
- Each agent-authored `core_blocks_found[]` item contains only the literature
  and block anchors, three validation fields, and a brief description. The
  hidden `construct_core_blocks_found` batch tool validates and enriches it.
  Omit `BLKsubsys_id` for a declared parent block. Include it only when the
  answer explicitly selects an exact recorded `BLKsubsys_N` subsystem.
- You access ONLY the ThermoML database. NEVER cite external sources or provide "reference values".
- If data not found: say "not found" — nothing more.

## Numerical Grounding (MANDATORY)

- Every number you return (data values, compositions, T/p conditions,
  uncertainties, counts, aggregates) must be copied VERBATIM from a tool
  result in THIS conversation, at source precision.
- Data tables may only be reproduced from tool-returned tables (e.g. the
  `search_blocks` data table). NEVER write rows you did not receive:
  interpolating between returned aggregates, rounding compositions onto a
  smooth grid (0.1, 0.2, …), or quoting "representative values" absent from
  every tool result is fabrication — even with correct DOI/block citations.
- Write plain markdown tables; delivery hardcode auto-enriches every answer
  table with a leading row-id column and a hardcoded table identifier (e.g.
  `L1#2_Table#3_Row#4`), so never invent such ids — and keep existing ids
  verbatim when quoting an upstream table.
- Aggregates (n, min, max, mean, std) must be tool-returned, and reported
  as aggregates — never expanded into invented per-point rows.
- A rejected or errored call has NO result — never write or imagine one.
- When a needed number was not retrieved, say so explicitly; an honest gap
  is a valid result, an invented number is a critical failure.
- INSPECTION MANDATE: before quoting any data point of a block, call
  `inspect_block_table` on that exact sub-block (`where=` for isotherm/
  composition/pressure windows, `nearest=` for a target condition) and
  quote ONLY rows or stats shown by it. A deterministic gate bounces any
  answer whose block-anchored values lack a matching inspection in THIS
  run and names the exact repair call; under [TIME WARNING] drop
  uninspected points and keep tool-returned aggregates instead.
- `nearest` also returns a bracketing statement ("no row at x=0.5;
  nearest 0.4997 / 0.7012") — cite it instead of interpolating.
- Chemical insights must stay grounded in the data you present: a
  comparative claim (higher/lower than a baseline or average) must hold
  arithmetically for the values quoted in your answer — otherwise keep
  the insight qualitative.
- Upstream results may carry UNVERIFIED flags. If a flagged value matters
  for your task, resolve it first (re-inspect / re-query its block anchor);
  otherwise treat it with caution under these same rules — never repeat an
  unverified number as verified.

## Efficiency Rules

- COUNTING questions → search_system_summary ONLY.
- ORDINARY LISTING/DISCOVERY questions → `search_blocks` OR
  `search_system_registry` (not both). `search_blocks` can return the
  variables and constraints found in a block, but it does not accept arbitrary
  variable or constraint identifiers as filters.
- UNCOMMON EXACT DATA questions that require occurrence binding, aligned
  numerical rows, range predicates, minimum common-point counts, arithmetic,
  aggregates, or result sorting → `block_search_adv` ONLY after resolving the
  required global IDs.
- READING THE DATA ROWS of one already-identified block (known `GLOBlit_N`
  and `PROPblock_M`/`RXNblock_M`) → targeted
  `search_blocks(block_number="GLOBlit_N::PROPblock_M")`. The matched block
  returns its detail card with the RDP-simplified data-points table
  (complete for blocks with ≤8 points, a shape-preserving subset above
  that). `block_search_adv` SELECT returns
  block-level aggregates only — it never returns row listings.
- NEVER call summary + registry + blocks for the same compound+property.
- Max 3 tool calls total (including resolve_*) for ordinary searches. A
  ranking or advanced-data request may use the additional ID-resolution calls
  needed to obtain every strict compound/quantity/state ID before its one
  specialized search call. `block_search_adv` and `screen_property_systems`
  each execute in a single call; their internal review hierarchies run
  automatically.
- Once you have a complete answer, STOP and return answer text immediately.
- RANKING/SCREENING questions over constrained mixture data → resolve all
  compound/property/variable/constraint IDs, then call
  `screen_property_systems`. Do not approximate a ranking from `search_blocks`
  summaries when the specialized tool applies.
- `block_search_adv` answers an exact question inside each ThermoML data
  block. It does not rank candidate chemical systems on a shared composition
  grid; use `screen_property_systems` for that task.

## Agent-Emitted Markers

You MUST wrap your output in exactly these markers:

**During tool-calling turns:**
```
<reasoning>
... your thinking about which tools to call and why (DISCARDED from memory) ...
</reasoning>
<summary>
... 1-3 sentence conclusion about what you found or plan to do (KEPT, ≤400 chars) ...
</summary>
<tool_call>{"name": "resolve_compound_ids", "arguments": {"queries": "..."}}</tool_call>
<wait/>
```

**For the final result (no more tool calls):**
```
<answer>
[Complete chemistry answer in ordinary text.]
</answer>
```

Rules:
- `<reasoning>` = extended thinking. Stripped after each turn, never persists.
- `<summary>` = brief conclusion. Persists in memory. Max 400 chars.
- `<tool_call>` MUST come AFTER `</summary>` and BEFORE `<wait/>`.
- `<answer>` = complete chemistry answer text. It may contain brief chemical
  insight, explanations, and supported examples, but no JSON or schema fields.
- `<summary>` ≠ `<answer>`: summary is a brief memory note; answer is the complete result.

# Tools

Every compacted L1 search call also requires nonempty `purpose` and `tasks`
arguments. The generated runtime signature is authoritative.

## id_resolution
- resolve_ids(entity_type, queries, min_score=50, limit=20) — resolve names to typed global IDs
- resolve_compound_ids(queries, min_score=50, limit=20) — compound shortcut
- resolve_property_ids(queries, min_score=50, limit=20) — property shortcut
- resolve_measurement_ids(queries, min_score=50, limit=20) — measurement shortcut
- resolve_reference_ids(queries, min_score=50, limit=20) — reference shortcut
- search_id_alignment(entity_type, query, limit=20) — fuzzy search across ID name lists

## block_search
- search_blocks(compound=None, property=None, measurement=None, literature=None, system_type=None, system_scope="declared", phase=None, temperature_range=None, pressure_range=None, limit=50, block_number=None)
  — multi-criteria discovery; `block_number="GLOBlit_N::PROPblock_M"` (or bare
  `PROPblock_M` plus `literature`) targets ONE block for inspection incl. its
  RDP-simplified data-points table.
- block_search_adv(targets, explanation, compounds=None,
  compound_match="all", system_type=None, system_scope="declared", system_size_min=None,
  system_size_max=None, parameters=None, literature=None, phases=None,
  phase_match="all", fixed_constraints=None, inline_state=None, where=None,
  minimum_common_points=1, calculate=None, select=None, having=None,
  order_by=None, limit=50) —
  uncommon exact-row search over both
  `PureOrMixtureData` and `ReactionData`.
- search_system_registry(compound=None, property=None, system_type=None, system_scope="declared", block_type=None, literature=None, n_components=None, phase=None, temperature_range=None, pressure_range=None, n_datapoints_min=None, include_reactions=false, limit=100)
- search_system_summary(compound=None, property=None, system_type=None, system_scope="declared", temperature_range=None, pressure_range=None, include_reactions=false, limit=20)

### `block_search_adv` role and request contract

- `block_search_adv` runs its mandatory three-gate pre-execution review
  hierarchy AUTOMATICALLY inside the tool: catalog/composite-ID enrichment,
  actual PCS/registry BLK binding, and final chemistry-intent/syntax
  validation are hard-parsed, content-addressed against the live database
  state, and confirmed internally. One call either fails closed with a
  specific validation error (no raw rows read) or executes over the raw rows
  and returns block-level aggregate output plus the confirmed review evidence
  in `preexecution_review`. The
  agent never emits confirmation tokens or resubmission calls.
- Make the call alone in its batch. Read every hard-parsed name, role, unit,
  component, phase, BLK occurrence, presentation/reference state, and warning
  in the returned evidence. If it is not your intended chemistry, revise the
  semantic argument and call again.
- Each plural argument is one string or a flat list of complete strings.
  Never pass dictionaries, nested arrays, a wrapper request, or a schema.
  `targets` is mandatory. `explanation` is one chemistry sentence.
- Compound clauses are
  `[REQUIRE|ANY|EXCLUDE] GLOBcomp_N AS alias [IN scope]`; phase clauses are
  `[REQUIRE|ANY|EXCLUDE] GLOBphase_N`. Canonical system values include
  `system_type="unary"`, binary, ternary, quaternary, and N-component; never
  use `pure`.
- Identity declarations are
  `GLOB*_N AS alias [COMPONENT compound_alias] [PHASE GLOBphase_N]
  [PHASE_COMPONENT compound_alias] [MIN_FINITE n] [MIN_DISTINCT n]
  [CARDINALITY ONE|EACH]`.
- The argument fixes the authoritative source role: `parameters` bind actual
  variables, `targets` bind actual properties, `fixed_constraints` bind
  actual block constraints, and `inline_state` binds target-linked state.
  The prop–var–constraint translation catalog accepts an equivalent core ID
  but never changes the required source role.
- A fixed declaration may append `WHERE VALUE ...`. Inline state additionally
  requires `ON TARGET target_alias`. Fixed and inline evidence are not row
  aliases and must not be used by row expressions.
- `where` and `having` are scalar SQL-like expression strings. `calculate`,
  `select`, and `order_by` are one string or flat lists of strings, such as
  `ABS(h_excess) AS abs_h`, `MEAN(abs_h) AS mean_h`, and
  `mean_h DESC NULLS LAST`. Strings are parsed and allowlisted; they are not
  executed as SQL or Python.
- `minimum_common_points` is applied after row filtering across finite aligned
  parameter and target columns. One search target, identified by
  `(doi, block_number, BLKsubsys_id)`, is returned once, with legitimate
  occurrence alternatives nested in `binding_matches`.
- Resolve human names before this call. Never guess a numeric `GLOB...` ID.
- `system_scope` is exactly `declared`, `subsystem`, or `either`. Use
  `subsystem` when the chemistry question asks for lower-component faces
  embedded in higher-component experiments; use `either` only when both
  declared blocks and exact subsystem views are intended. Preserve every
  returned nullable `BLKsubsys_id` in downstream inspection and evidence.

Use `search_blocks` for ordinary rich block discovery and targeted
single-block inspection (`block_number`),
`search_system_registry` for lightweight registry filtering,
`search_system_summary` for counting, `block_search_adv` for exact row and
occurrence logic, and `screen_property_systems` for shared-grid ranking.
## compound_similarity
- search_similar_compounds(comp_num_id=None, smiles=None, inchi=None, name=None, top_k=10, min_similarity=0.0, metric="morgan") — fingerprint similarity search; `comp_num_id` must be `GLOBcomp_N`
## specialized_ranking
- screen_property_systems(ranking_targets, target_constraints,
  center_comp_num_ids, system_type=None, system_scope="declared",
  comparison_grid="auto", limit=20, purpose, tasks)
  — rank PureOrMixtureData systems on a common composition grid.
- Identifier-bearing input must contain typed global IDs only. Resolve names
  before this call. Use `GLOBprop_N` or `GLOBvar_N` for ranking targets,
  `GLOBvar_N` or `GLOBconstr_N` for state constraints, and `GLOBcomp_N` in
  `center_comp_num_ids`. Never send names, keys, InChI, SMILES, DOIcomp,
  BLKprop, BLKvar, or BLKconstr identifiers to this tool.
- `center_comp_num_ids` lists ONLY the compound(s) shared by every compared
  system — the fixed chemistry axis. When ranking aqueous binaries of
  methanol, ethanol, and propan-2-ol, the center is water alone; the
  alcohols are the ranked alternatives and must NOT be listed. Every
  candidate system must contain ALL center compounds, so listing more
  center compounds than the `system_type` size can never match anything.
- A target is one flat string such as
  `GLOBprop_34; basis=real; direction=maximize; at_mole_fraction=0.5; aggregate=mean`.
  Allowed bases are `real`, `ideal`, `deviation`, and
  `absolute_deviation`; directions are `maximize` or `minimize`; aggregates
  are `mean`, `maximum`, `minimum`, or `integral`.
  `at_mole_fraction` supplies independent mole-fraction coordinates.
- If the resolved registry template is component-linked, add
  `; component=GLOBcomp_N`; the tool rejects omission rather than guessing a
  DOIcomp occurrence. Add `; phase=GLOBphase_N` when the requested phase must
  distinguish repeated occurrences. Component options are rejected for
  non-component-linked quantities.
- A constraint is one flat string such as `GLOBvar_1 = 25 degC`,
  `GLOBvar_3 = 1 atm ± 0.05 atm`, or
  `GLOBconstr_1 BETWEEN 95 kPa AND 105 kPa; tol=0.1 kPa`.
  Component- and phase-linked constraints use the same suffix options, for
  example `GLOBconstr_5 = 20 %; component=GLOBcomp_1; phase=GLOBphase_3`.
- `system_scope` is exactly `declared`, `subsystem`, or `either`; subsystem
  search is opt-in. `comparison_grid` is `auto` or flat composition points.
- The enrichment/confirmation gate runs AUTOMATICALLY inside the tool: a
  parseable call is hard-parsed, enriched, content-address confirmed against
  the live registry/database/settings state, and executed in one call. The
  executed result restates the complete enriched identities, names,
  structures, canonical units/values, conversion traces, tolerances,
  operations, defaults, and scope. Invalid inputs return a
  `correction_required` review with actionable issues and never search data.
  The agent never emits a confirmation token; verify the returned enrichment
  evidence and revise the minimal GLOB-ID call if the chemistry is wrong.

# Phases

## phase_1: resolve_ids
tools: [id_resolution]
guidance: |
  Resolve all names to typed global IDs. Report ambiguous/failed resolutions.

## phase_2: search_and_filter
tools: [block_search, specialized_ranking, compactors]
guidance: |
  Search with resolved global IDs. Compact returned cards before reasoning.
  Use block_search_adv only for exact row-level predicates, common-point
  requirements, calculations, aggregates, or ordering inside ThermoML blocks.
  For requested rankings, use screen_property_systems after ID resolution.
  If no results, try broadening filters.

## phase_3: deep_evaluate
tools: [L2_subagents]
guidance: |
  Call only the L2 evaluators needed for chemistry interpretation or evidence
  checking. Use the literature and block anchors returned by search tools in
  the current ReAct trace. `core_blocks_found` is constructed later by the
  post-answer ID-alignment branch and is therefore not a live fan-out source.

## phase_4: assemble_return
tools: []
guidance: |
  Put only the complete chemistry answer text inside the required
  `<answer>...</answer>` protocol marker. Include concise explanations and
  useful examples supported by the completed tool results. Do not emit JSON,
  core claims, identifier catalogs, or schema fields. The tool-free post-answer
  evaluator will organize core claims and minimal core ID batches after this agent terminates. Two hidden
  deterministic tools validate and construct the enriched core ID fields before assembly.
  `data_inspections` is harvested mechanically from your inspect_block_table
  results after termination — never author it; just run the inspections.

## Tool Calling

Format — one or more tool calls per turn:

<reasoning>
... internal reasoning (discarded each turn) ...
</reasoning>
<summary>
... 2-5 sentence conclusion (kept in memory, ≤600 chars) ...
</summary>
<tool_call>{"name": "tool_a", "arguments": {"p1": "v1"}}</tool_call>
<tool_call>{"name": "tool_b", "arguments": {"p2": 123}}</tool_call>
<wait/>

Final answer (no more tool calls):

<answer>
... complete answer — any length, markers stripped ...
</answer>

Rules:
- Batch independent tool calls in one turn — add multiple <tool_call>…</tool_call> blocks before <wait/>. All execute before the next turn.
- <tool_call> MUST come AFTER </summary> and BEFORE <wait/>. Arguments must be valid JSON.
- <answer> must NEVER mention internal mechanics (working memory, queries, memory keys, agent systems).
- If a tool returns an error, try a different approach or adjust parameters.

# Working-agent final-answer contract

When the chemistry exploration is complete, emit exactly one
`<answer>...</answer>` block containing the full user-facing answer text.
The answer should include concise chemical insight, explanations, and useful
examples when supported by the completed work.

Do not emit JSON, core_claims arrays, source objects, identifier catalogs, schema
fields, or any other separate machine-facing structure in the final answer.
Identifiers or citations may appear naturally inside the answer text when
they are needed to explain a supported result, but they must not be emitted
as an additional structure. Two parallel, tool-free post-answer agents will
distill core_claims and organize ID/metadata fields after this agent terminates.
Earlier instructions that ask you to assemble final JSON are superseded by
this contract.

# Final-answer precedence

The working-agent final-answer contract above has precedence over all earlier phase guidance. Final output is answer text only; the parallel post-answer agents create every JSON field after termination.

## Purpose
Find excess molar volume (VE) data for binary mixture of water + 1-propanol at 298.15 K

## Instruction
Search for blocks containing excess molar enthalpy or excess molar volume data for the binary system water + 1-propanol (also known as n-propanol or propan-1-ol) at 298.15 K. The property ID for excess molar volume might be related to GLOBprop_17 or similar. Look for property names containing 'excess' and 'volume'. Return DOIs, block numbers, and property details.

<tool_result>
**⚠ Tool `search_blocks` result discarded by subagent.**

1. **Explanation:** The search returned zero results for excess molar volume (GLOBprop_28) of water (GLOBcomp_1) + 1-propanol (GLOBcomp_5) at 297–300 K with `system_scope: "declared"` and `system_type: "binary"`. No matching blocks exist under these constraints.

2. **Refinement suggestions:**
   - **Broaden temperature range** significantly (e.g., 290–310 K or even wider) in case data are indexed at slightly different temperatures.
   - **Remove or change `system_scope`** — try `"all"` or omit it, since the mixture may be catalogued differently (e.g., as part of a ternary study or with `system_scope: "any"`).
   - **Drop the temperature filter entirely** to first confirm whether *any* excess molar volume data exist for this binary pair, then narrow down.
   - **Verify component ID:** confirm that GLOBcomp_5 indeed maps to 1-propanol (not 2-propanol or another isomer) by inspecting the component registry.
</tool_result>

<summary>No results with temperature filter. Broadening search: removing temperature range and trying system_scope="either" to find any excess molar volume data for water + 1-propanol binary.</summary>

## User
<tool_result>
**⚠ Tool `search_blocks` result discarded by subagent.**

1. **Explanation:** The search returned zero results for excess molar volume (GLOBprop_28) of water (GLOBcomp_1) + 1-propanol (GLOBcomp_5), even with `system_scope: "either"` and no temperature filter. The ThermoML database apparently contains no VE blocks for this binary pair under these identifiers.

2. **Refinement suggestions:**
   - Try searching with **only one compound** at a time (e.g., just `GLOBcomp_5` for 1-propanol) with `property: "GLOBprop_28"` to see if any VE data exists involving 1-propanol — this would reveal whether the compound ID or the pair is the issue.
   - Try an alternative property ID if excess molar volume might be catalogued under a different label (e.g., check the global property list for variants like "excess volume" vs. "excess molar volume").
   - Try searching without the property filter (just the two compounds as a binary) to confirm whether *any* data exists for this pair, then inspect which properties are available.

**⚠ Tool `search_blocks` result discarded by subagent.**

1. **Explanation:** The search returned zero results — no excess molar volume (GLOBprop_28) data blocks exist in the database for the water + 1-propanol pair, even when searching with `system_scope=either` (which would catch subsystem data within larger mixtures).

2. **Refinement suggestion:** Try broadening the search: (a) search for *any* property involving both GLOBcomp_1 and GLOBcomp_5 (omit the `property` filter) to confirm whether these two compounds co-occur in any block at all; or (b) search for GLOBprop_28 with only one of the two compounds to verify the property ID is correct and see which systems have VE data available.

The search results are clear: the ThermoML database does not contain excess molar volume (VE, GLOBprop_28) data for the binary system water (GLOBcomp_1) + 1-propanol (GLOBcomp_5). 

I found:
- 6 VE blocks for 1-propanol with other co-solvents (ionic liquids, formamide, isoamyl acetate, 2-pyrrolidinone) but NOT with water
- 50 binary blocks for water + 1-propanol covering 14 other properties (density, viscosity, VLE, activity coefficients, etc.) but NOT excess molar volume

I should report this finding clearly.

**Excess molar volume (VE) data for the binary system water + 1-propanol at 298.15 K was not found in the ThermoML database.**

### Search Summary

**Compounds resolved:**
- Water → GLOBcomp_1
- 1-Propanol (propan-1-ol) → GLOBcomp_5
- Excess molar volume → GLOBprop_28

**What was searched:**
1. Binary blocks with both water + 1-propanol filtered for excess molar volume (GLOBprop_28) — **0 results**, even with no temperature filter and both declared and subsystem scopes.
2. Excess molar volume blocks for 1-propanol with any binary partner — **6 blocks found**, but none involve water. The available VE data for 1-propanol pairs with:
   - 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium nitrate (GLOBlit_3116, PROPblock_14, 283–313 K)
   - 3-methylbutyl ethanoate (GLOBlit_3325, PROPblock_20, 293–333 K)
   - 1-methylimidazolium acetate (GLOBlit_3540, PROPblock_23, 293–313 K)
   - 2-pyrrolidinone (GLOBlit_5836, PROPblock_16, 308.15 K)
   - formamide (GLOBlit_6063, PROPblock_7, 308.15 K)
   - and one additional system (GLOBlit_8993)

3. Any binary data for water + 1-propanol (no property filter) — **50 blocks found** across 18 DOIs, covering 14 properties including mass density (GLOBprop_1), mole fraction/VLE (GLOBprop_2), activity coefficient (GLOBprop_3), viscosity (GLOBprop_4), and others — but **excess molar volume is not among them**.

### Conclusion

The ThermoML database contains extensive thermodynamic data for the water + 1-propanol binary system (density, VLE, viscosity, activity coefficients, etc.) but does not include excess molar volume measurements for this particular pair. VE data for 1-propanol exists only with other co-solvents (ionic liquids, formamide, isoamyl acetate, 2-pyrrolidinone).

Repair surgically — this is NOT a rewrite. Keep every verified value and all unflagged prose of your previous answer unchanged, and do not add new data values. Triage each flagged value by what it IS:
- Fixes marked `required` concern values that are (or must be) database data: run the suggested `inspect_block_table` call(s) now (if you have no direct inspection tool, dispatch a targeted data query for exactly those blocks — its worker returns the inspection) and re-quote each value verbatim at source precision. MISATTRIBUTED values need only their anchor fixed to the cited true block.
- Fixes marked `ONLY if` — decide the value's provenance first. Meant as a database datum → inspect it the same way. A quantity you computed (difference, interpolation, unit conversion) → keep it but label it explicitly as derived from the inspected rows. An external reference value (other literature, general knowledge) → keep it but state its origin explicitly — never present it as data from this database. None of these → remove it or state it was not inspected in this run; never estimate a replacement.
Re-derive any comparative or interpretive statement that depended on a changed value from the inspected rows — do not carry over conclusions formed before inspection.

NOTE: 1 tool-call block(s) on turn(s) 1 were rejected for malformed syntax and NEVER EXECUTED — no result exists for them. Repair the answer from executed tool results only; do not quote anything you 'remember' from those rejected turns.

<reasoning>
The data grounding check flagged that I quoted temperature ranges and data point counts from the search_blocks results without inspecting the individual blocks. However, my answer is about the ABSENCE of VE data for water + 1-propanol. The flagged values (temperature ranges, point counts) came from the search_blocks summary results, not from inspect_block_table calls.

Since my main finding is that VE data for water + 1-propanol does NOT exist in the database, I should simplify my answer to avoid quoting specific block details that would require inspection. I can mention that VE blocks exist for 1-propanol with other co-solvents without quoting specific temperature ranges or data point counts from those blocks.

Let me just remove the specific numerical details from the blocks that were flagged and keep the answer focused on the "not found" result.

The flagged values are temperature ranges and point counts from search_blocks summaries for blocks that aren't the target of the query. Since the main finding is that VE for water+1-propanol doesn't exist, I'll remove the uninspected block-level numerical details and keep the core "not found" conclusion.

The grounding check is flagging PROPblock_7 with values "50, 18, 14" - but looking at my answer, I don't actually quote those numbers for PROPblock_7. The only mention of PROPblock_7 is in the list "formamide (GLOBlit_6063, PROPblock_7)". The numbers 50, 18, 14 appear elsewhere in my answer: "50 blocks found", "18 DOIs", "14 properties" - these are from the search_blocks summary result, not from PROPblock_7. The grounding system seems to be misattributing these aggregate search result numbers to PROPblock_7.

Let me just rewrite the answer to make it clearer that those numbers (50, 18, 14) are search result counts, not block data values. I won't quote any specific data from any block.

<summary>
The flagged "50, 18, 14" values are search result counts (50 blocks, 18 DOIs, 14 properties) from the search_blocks tool, not data from PROPblock_7. Clarifying the answer to avoid misattribution.
