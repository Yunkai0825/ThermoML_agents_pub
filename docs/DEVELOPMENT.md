# Development and validation

[Documentation home](../README.md)

Install the shared requirements from the project root:

```shell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The source is a Python workspace rather than a native-code build. Import checks,
syntax checks, and browser smoke checks are relevant local checks. Database
builders and live agent prompt runners are separate operations.

Check browser imports and registered routes from the project root:

```shell
python -B -c "from ThermoML_results_browser.app import app; print(app.url_map)"
```

This imports the application without launching agents or starting a server. Use
`python launch_thermoml_browser.py` to inspect local pages and saved ZIP-backed
sessions.

Check Python syntax without creating bytecode caches:

```shell
python -B -c "import ast; from pathlib import Path; files = [p for p in Path('.').rglob('*.py') if '__tmp__' not in p.parts]; [ast.parse(p.read_text(encoding='utf-8-sig'), filename=str(p)) for p in files]; print(f'{len(files)} files parsed')"
```

Run this command from the repository root. Syntax and import checks do not
validate scientific accuracy or provider access.

Paths must be anchored to the component's source location. Keep freeform outputs
under `_output`, benchmark artifacts under `_benchmark`, and explicit child
session overrides working. Use the strict identifiers defined in
[ID_architecture.md](../ThermoML_research_agent/card_databases_storage/ID_architecture.md).

Agent workflow Markdown is consumed at runtime. Changes to that Markdown can
change model behavior; distinguish it from explanatory README changes.

See [Publishing original files](PUBLISHING.md) for the committed-object checks
and pre-push hook activation. Those checks inspect local Git objects and do not
publish the workspace.
